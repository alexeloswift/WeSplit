This is an app that helps you calculate how much tip you need to leave amongst a group of friends.

In this app my challenges were:

Add a header to the third section, saying “Amount per person”

Add another section showing the total amount for the check – i.e., the original amount plus tip value, without dividing by the number of people.

Change the tip percentage picker to show a new screen rather than using a segmented control, and give it a wider range of options – everything from 0% to 100%.
